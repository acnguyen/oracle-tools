The Testing Support Module
--------------------------

<h4>Overview</h4>
The Oracle Tools Testing Support module provides a number of extensions to simplify
testing concurrent and distributed applications.

As this module makes significant use of the concept of Deferred References, we recommend
reading the [Introduction to Deferred References](../core/deferreds.html) for initial
examples and background information.

<h4>Distribution</h4>

The Oracle Tools Testing Support module is distributed as a single jar
called: `oracle-tools-testing-support-${project.version}.jar`

<h4>Source Code</h4>

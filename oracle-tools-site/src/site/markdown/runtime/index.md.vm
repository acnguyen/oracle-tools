The Runtime Module for Oracle Tools
-----------------------------------

<h4>Overview</h4>
The Oracle Tools Runtime module provides a high-level framework that allows
developers to define, create, monitor and manage other applications and
associated processes at runtime.

An introduction to these concepts is covered by the
[Introduction to Application Runtime Management](applications.html).

<h4>Distribution</h4>

The Oracle Tools Runtime module is distributed as a single jar called: `oracle-tools-runtime-${project.version}.jar`
